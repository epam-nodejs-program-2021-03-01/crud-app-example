## Endpoints

- `GET /` – health-check

### Users

- `GET /users` – get list of all users
	- `GET /users?login-substring=<string>` – get list of all users, whose login contains the given substring

- `POST /users` – create new user
- `GET /users/:id` – get user by their ID
- `PATCH /users/:id` – update user by their ID
- `DELETE /users/:id` – delete user by their ID

### Groups

- `GET /groups` – get list of all groups
- `POST /groups` – create new group
- `GET /groups/:id` – get group by its ID
	- `GET /groups/:id?users=<any>` – get group by its ID, include information about members
	- `GET /groups/:id?users=<"0"|"false">` – get group by its ID, without information about members
- `PATCH /groups/:id` – update group by its ID
- `DELETE /groups/:id` – delete group by its ID
- `GET /groups/:id/users` – get a list of all members of the group
- `PUT /groups/:id/users` – add members to the group

## Scripts

### Build

- `npm run build`

	Builds an output code from the source code. This also runs "pre-" and "postbuild" hooks that help making a cleaner build.

- `npm run clean`

	Prunes the contents of the output directory, – usually, this is needed to remove leftovers from the previous builds.

- `npm run build:only`

	Builds an output code from the source code, without performing any additional file management through the hooks.

### Verify

- `npm run compile`

	Verify that the code is able to be built without actually building it.

- `npm run lint`

	Verify the code-style (run `npm run lint -- --fix` to also attempt auto-fixing the found issues).

- `npm run test`

	Verify the source code by running all test suites.

- `npm run test:unit`

	Verify the source code by running unit tests.

- `npm run test:integration`

	Verify the source code by running integration tests.

### Run

- `npm run dev`

	_(intended for a local environment)_ Runs the source code of the application.

- `npm run play`

	_(intended for a local environment)_ Runs the code in the playground file.

- `npm start`

	_(intended for a remote environment)_ Runs the compiled code of the application (the compiled code must exist prior to that).
